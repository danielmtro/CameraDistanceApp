# Current Approaches

## Distance to camera based off eye tracking 

- Can work well - however key problem is that you aren't cross-eyed by the time the camera comes close
- Fairly impossible given front camera

## External Measurement using Virtual Ruler - Constant Depth Side on View

- Can implement virtual ruler fairly accurately here.
- Difficult to see the eyes and determine when you actually go cross-eyed.
- Not feasible in this regard.

## External Measurement using Virtual Ruler - Angled with Eyes in view.

- Need to rely on external AR SDK kits.
- In progress...
