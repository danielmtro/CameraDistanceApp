# Research for novel distance calculation

# Random Ideas

- Consider using the direction that the eyes are looking at to determine distance based off simple trig

# Research Papers

## 1. Vision-Based Distance Estimation for Multiple Vehicles Using Single Optical Camera

DOI: 10.1109/IBICA.2011.7

Summary:

- Determines distance from cars to a camera
- Uses the size of a licence plate as a known value to then perform calculations

Takeaways:
- Could potentially use facial features as a reference and then calculate distance based on pixel size


## 2. Face distance estimation from a monocular camera

DOI: 10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738729

Summary: 

- Uses a neural network to determine distance from the face
- Takes a reference scan of each user to determine facial parameters
- Uses facial parameter data as inputs to a neural network and outputs distance.
- Facial parameters pictured below:

Takeaways:

- Kind of combines takeaways from previous by using reference points and standard values but generalises further
- Could have a strong performance here
